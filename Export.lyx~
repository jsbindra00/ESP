Agile Software Development
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
Manifesto for Agile Software Development 
\emph default
is based on 12 principles:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Customer Satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Deliver working software frequently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Projects are built around motivated individuals who should be trusted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Face to face conversation is the best form of communication.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Working software is the primary measure of progress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Simplicity - the art of maximising the amount of work not done is essential
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Best architectures and designsemerge from self organising teams.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
The team regularly reflects on how to become more effective and adjusts
 accordingly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
How can one enforce Agile Software Development?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Break product development into small increments that minimise the amount
 of up front planning and designs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Enforce iterations or sprints, which involves a multi-disciplinary team
 working on: planning, analysis, design, coding, unit testing, and acceptance
 testing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fail often and fail early with incremental development; working software
 is the primary measure of progress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Enforce Face to face communication with team members and stakeholders.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Delegate a customer representative to act on behalf of the opinions of stakehold
ers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Customer opinions determine the direction of the next sprint / workflow.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Daily standup: 15 minute session where members collectively review how they
 are progressing towards their goal, and note criticisms and improvements.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Focus on quality of architecture:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Continuous integration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Unit testing, test driven development.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Pair programming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Enforcing design patterns onto the architecture.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Where is ASD appropriate?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Complex systems with dynamic, non deterministic and non linear characteristics,
 since accurate estimates and stable plans are hard to get in early stages.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In a desire to reduce the 
\emph on
leap of faith 
\emph default
that is needed before any evidence of value can be obtained, in system developme
nt.

\emph on
Legal, Ethical and Professional Conduct
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a number of 
\emph on
standards 
\emph default
which highlight a set of axioms by which software engineers should operate,
 to encourage ethical and legal behaviour:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\emph on
ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) [58,68]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\emph on
IEEE [69,74]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
IEEE enforces 8 practices which software engineers should take with regards
 to ethics and professional practices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\emph on
BSS [75,77]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
BSS enforces four key principles which serve as a code of conduct for profession
alism to software engineers.

UML Models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
UML Case Diagrams
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
UML Models encapsulate the workflow of your application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All application events are inside a box.
 All external interactions which produce these events are outside of the
 box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Actors 
\series default
produce events, in which case a line is drawn from the actor to the event(s).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Events 
\series default
are drawn in circles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Event chains 
\series default
are defined by:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
<<include>>, which 
\begin_inset Formula $\implies$
\end_inset

 the next event.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
<<extend>>, which could be 
\begin_inset Formula $\implies$
\end_inset

 the next event.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Events can be defined further by establishing a hierarchy which explains
 the proper subtypes of said event.

UML Sequence Diagrams
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
UML Sequence Diagrams are a type of UQL diagram show how classes in code
 interact with each other, in order, namely the sequence of events.
 Used to document processes and understand the requirements of a new program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Actors 
\series default
interact with 
\series bold
Objects
\emph on
.
 
\series default
\emph default
Objects are placed in sequential order, and are in squares.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Lifelines 
\series default
are vertical dashed lines which show the existence of the object over time
 (time axis is vertical).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Messages 
\series default
show the messages being sent between objects.
 These are indicated with solid lines.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Return Messages 
\series default
are dashed lines and are responses to messages.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Alternative Frames
\series default
 are basically conditional branches, which symbolises a choice between two
 message sequences.
 It is encapsulated in a box around the target message sequences.
