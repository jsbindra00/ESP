\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Respect for persons:

Individuals should be treated as autonomous agents (they can make their

Information

: Participants should have access to the risks or benefits of the research;
 the ability to ask questions and withdraw at any time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

Comprehension:

Information must be provided in a coherent manner which would not curtail
 the participants ability to make an informed decision.
 It is your responsibility to ensure that they have comprehended the information.

\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
When working with anonymised data, it may not be possible to extract an
 individuals data.
 Participants must be made aware of this, and depending on how the data
 is anonymised, you may want to consider a 
\emph on
grace period 
\emph default
where you can give participants to withdraw their data, after which the
 data will be anonymised.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Standard
We are laying concrete definitions and focusing on a problem that the user(s)
 may experience.
 Our goal is to develop a deep understanding of the users and the design

 We can analyse our Empathy findings by the following:

Now that we have an actionable problem statement, as well as a rough reference

 The goal now, is to explore a large solution space and develop a large,
 diverse set of ideas.
 From this tree of ideas, we can begin to prune and build prototypes to
 test with users.
